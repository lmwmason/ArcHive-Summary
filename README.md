# **Project Title: ArcHive-Summary - AI-Powered Academic Paper Summarizer**

### **1. Project Overview**

ArcHive-Summary is designed to drastically reduce the time and effort required to read and comprehend dense academic literature. By utilizing cutting-edge **Multimodal analysis technology**, the service deeply analyzes the content of user-uploaded papers (PDFs) to deliver fast, accurate, and structurally organized summary reports.

**ðŸš€ Goal:** To maximize research and learning efficiency by dramatically cutting down the time spent on reading and synthesizing academic materials.

### **2. Core Features**

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** of this project focuses on accepting PDF input and generating structured summary text output.

| Feature | Detailed Description | Technical Processing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PDF Document Upload** | Users can upload PDF files up to 50MB directly to the website. | **Multimodal Document Processing** is used to ingest the PDF file content directly as input for the analysis system. |
| **Core Summary Extraction** | The system analyzes the entire paper to accurately extract the main subject, research methodology, key findings, and final conclusion. | A **Highly Advanced Large Language Model** is employed for rapid logical structure identification and text summarization. |
| **Structured Report Output** | The summary is delivered not as a simple text block, but as a clean, highly readable, sectioned report using the **Markdown format**. | **Output Formatting Control** techniques enforce a clear structure, typically including **Title, Abstract, Key Findings (bullet points), and Conclusion.** |
| **Target Level Adjustment (Future)** | (Future Expansion) The option to adjust the summary's complexity to levels such as **'High School Level'** or 'Undergraduate Level' will be introduced for user customization. |
